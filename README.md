Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Efficient Frontier
Overview:
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is a fundamental framework for constructing optimal investment portfolios. MPT provides a systematic approach to portfolio management by considering the trade-off between risk and return. At its core, MPT emphasizes diversification as a means to reduce portfolio risk while maximizing returns.

In this project aims to implement Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct an efficient frontier for optimal portfolio allocation. In this project i use historical financial data of Indian stocks and advanced statistical techniques to analyze asset returns , Covariance and correlations.

Steps Performed:-
1.Data Collection
2.Data Preprocessing
3.Statistical Analysis
4.Portfolio Optimization
5.Efficient Frontier
